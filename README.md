# Zero Configuration with Browser or API Key setup Methods

1. [**Default**] Use OpenAI's official ChatGPT APIs - Use your personal/organizational API Keys. This method provides many parameters to customize your prompt. Check out the GPT3 settings. For more details: [GPT3 OpenAI API Key](#api-key-setup)
2. Autologin - Uses browser to ask questions to ChatGPT. Zero-Config Autologin lets the extension grab the required tokens automatically using `puppeteer`. The extension will use the browser behind the scenes, so you are not expected to receive 4xx errors while asking ChatGPT via extension unless there is OpenAI outages. [Autologin Setup (Default)](#browser-setup)

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kbmjj123/zd-vscode-chatgpt/main/images/methods.png">

# API Key Setup

Get your API Key ready from here: [OpenAI](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)

1. Click `Login` in your extension or ask any coding question by selecting a code fragment.
2. Once asked provide your API Key to the extension
   - [Optional] You could also store your API Key in your settings.json. However, it's highly discouraged due to security reasons.

# Browser Setup

> ‚ùï Please do not interrupt the autologin flow and do not close the browser. Let the extension log you in and the browser will be minimized automatically.

üöÄ All you need to do is click Login or ask a question to get started!

1. Click on the ChatGPT extension icon on your sidebar and hit `Login` button.

2. A new browser window (Default is `Chrome` but you may override it with any Chromium-based browser) will open up redirected to https://chat.openai.com/. Wait till you see login page, and click on Login on your browser.

   - If you see a `ChatGPT is at capacity right now` message, the extension will refresh the page every 2 seconds until it's passed. If OpenAI systems are experiencing issues and the extension fails to see Login page after 10 retries, the browser will be automatically closed.

3. Solve captchas if you are prompted and continue.

4. After successfully logging in, the browser will be minimized.

üîë Use Google, Microsoft or standard OpenAI credentials to login. The email/password will be used to autofill the login form depending on the authentication type you choose. **NOTE**: We don't recommend storing your password in your settings.json since the file is plain text. However, you can opt-in to use it to reduce the friction during logins.

‚ÑπÔ∏è You will need to have a browser open and be logged in at all times. If you close the browser or your VS-Code instance, you will be asked to login again in your next session.

üìù You can have the extension auto-fill the email address and/or password during logins. Update the extension settings with those information for quicker login. NOTE: We never store any of this information locally or remotely.

ü§ñ Below is a sample autologin flow. Simply login & keep your browser minimized for dialogues with ChatGPT:

## Override settings with any Chromium-based browser

1. To use `Edge`, go to this URL: `edge://version` and copy the executable path used by your Edge browser.
2. Override the chromium path by going to vs-code settings and search for `chatgpt:chromiumPath`. Paste the executable path. i.e. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft\Edge\Application\msedge.exe`
3. [Maybe required] Run `ChatGPT: Reset session` command to clear your previous browser selection. This is required only if you have previously authenticated using a different browser.

### Run on Linux or remote - SSH workspace

There are community members who are able to run the extension in WSL, Linux, remote-SSH workspaces. Please check these issues for instructions.

## Customization settings

- Use proxy with autologin puppeteer setup
- Opt-in to use automation to authenticate OpenAI.
- You can configure the commands to use any prompts for the selected code!
- Opt-in to receive notification when ChatGPT sends you a message!

### Using Proxy

The autologin supports setting a proxy server. This is useful if you're running into rate limiting issues or if you want to use a proxy to hide your IP address. Right now this setting only supports http proxies. Don't provide a protocol in the setting.

To use a proxy, update the settings with your proxy server details. For more information on the format, see [here](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/network-settings).

Format examples:

- Authenticated: `myUsername:myPassword@my.proxy.com:3001`
- Anonymous: `204.137.172.37:999`

# Troubleshooting

- It's possible that OpenAI systems may experience issues responding to your queries due to high-traffic from time to time.
- If you get `404 NotFound` error, it means one of the parameters you provided is unknown (i.e. `chatgpt.gpt3.model`). Most likely switching to default `model` in your settings would fix this issue.
- If you get `400 BadRequest` error with API Key based method, it means that your conversation's length is more than GPT/Codex models can handle. Clear your conversation history with `ChatGPT: Clear conversation` command and retry sending your prompt.
- If you get `ChatGPT is at capacity right now` during autologin, the extension will refresh the page every 2 seconds until you see the login page. Refreshing may help in some cases, when there is a queue. This is unfortunately out of this extension's control. If, even after refresh, OpenAI shows capacity error, the browser will close automatically.
- If you get `ChatGPTAPI error 429`, it means that you are making Too Many Requests. Please wait and try again in a few moments. If it persists, restart your vs-code.
  - This could also be due to multiple browser/requests being active on OpenAI. Make sure that none of your API Keys are being actively used at the moment.
  - You could also try re-generating a new API Key [here](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys)
- If you see `ChatGPTAPI error terminated`, your requests are being throttled. Please try again later.
- If you encounter persistent issues with your queries
  - Try `ChatGPT: Reset session` command
  - As a last resort try restarting your VS-Code and retry logging in.
- If you are using Remote Development and cant login to ChatGPT
  - In settings.json add
  - "remote.extensionKind": {"kbmjj123.zd-vscode-chatgpt": ["ui"]}

- There is no guarantee that the extension will continue to work as-is without any issues or side-effects. Please use it at your own risk. It may stop working without a notice e.g. OpenAI may decide to change all or some of its functionality, which will affect this extension.
- This extension never uses/stores your personally identifiable information. There are some optional settings that you may opt-in to use i.e. OpenAI API Key. Please be careful of what you are storing in your settings.json file, since vs-code may sync them across their instances and it's outside of this extension's boundary. We recommend not storing any personally identifiable information in your settings.json.
- This extension collects metadata to improve its features. No personally identifiable information is collected. You can opt-out from telemetry either by setting the global 'telemetry.telemetryLevel' or 'chatgpt.telemetry.disable'. The extension will respect both of these settings and will collect metadata only if both allow telemetry. We use the official telemetry package provided by the vscode team [here](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-extension-telemetry) to understand this extension's usage patterns better to plan new feature releases i.e. popularity of Browser-based autologin vs. API Key method setting.
